# 3D-Game-Project
#### This game is developed using python (openGL library) as a final project of Graphics Course (for educational purposes) with my team

## Description:
The main ball -which represents the player- moving on a road tries to collect all other balls of the same color, as a result increasing the score. In case of hitting another ball that has a different color, it dies and the game is over!
The game is endless. So, as the score increases, the levels is getting harder. The Difficulty of the game depends mainly on increasing the number of balls -either of the same or distinct color-. In addition, moving walls which change the main ball color when passing through it.
Besides, There exist some interface frames for start , Pause, winning, continue, Game Over!
